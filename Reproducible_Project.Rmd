### Synopsis

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Data Processing

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

```{r get data}
fileurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
download.file(fileurl, destfile = "weatherdataset.zip")
unzip("weatherdataset.zip")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
